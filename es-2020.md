ECMA and the TC39

ECMA is a n internation standards body.

ES = ECMAScript. The official standard for JavaScript*

*\* JavaScript is a U.S. traedmark helb by Oracle Corporation*

## The TC39 process

Meetings at various locations every 2 months. A yearly release, usually in June.

**ES3**

~~**ES4**~~

**ES5**

**ES6** => **ES2015**

**ES7** => **ES2016**

There is *no* **~~ES8~~** only **ES2017**

It's all open https://github.com/tc39

### Language proposals

**Stage 0 - Strawman:** "It'd be dandy if we had  unicord operator to..."

**Stage 1 - Proposal:** A TC39 member "champions the proposal. General API look and feel hammered down, and many/most cross-cutting concerns addressed.

**Stage 2 - Draft:** Initial spec text, covers all critical aspects and technical semantics.

**Stage 3 - Candidate:** Spec complete, verified by appropriate reviewers and greenlighted. API finalized, no stone left unturned. 

**Stage 4 - Finished:** Fully tested (https://github.com/tc39/test262). Spec editor has signed off on the proposal. shipping runtimes must already support it. Usually v8 + chakracore or firefox.

## ES2017

- Trailing commas in more places (function parameters). 
- async/await

## Stage 2 or 3 (Mostly ES2019, some ES2020)

- Async iterators `for await` and `async function*`.

- Rest / Spread or objects (eg. Objects are now Iterable by default).

- RegExp improvements (can use XRegExp today).

  - Named capture groups.
  - Unicode property escapes.
  - Lookbehind assertions.
  - RegExp DotAll flag `/s` modifier makes `.` cover line breaks.

- Promise.finally.

- Lifting template literal restrictions. https://tc39.github.io/proposal-template-literal-revision/.

- Class Fields!!! - **@stage3**

  - class fields.
  - private class fields.
  - static fields/methods.

- Private methods and accessors - **@stage2**

- Dynamic import() like the one used in webpack, but more powerful.

- Optional catch binding parameter.

- Throw expressions (no longer a statement).

- Decorators - **@stage2**

  - Decorators were stage-3 ~3 years ago but had to go back to stage-1.

- Numeric separator - **@stage3**

  `1_000_000_000` or `0.000_030_123`.

## Later Stage <=1

- Optional chaining `thing?.otherthing?.other` with the Elvis operator. `?.` 
- Nullish coalescing `??`
- Genuine protocols and maximally-minimal mixins (kind of like an interface). Merging for stage 2.
- Do expressions
- Pipeline operator `|>`
- Partial expressions (more flexible than with bind).  **@stage0**

```js
const newScore = score
  |> add(7, ?)
  |> score(team2, ?, refereree);
```

- Pattern matching **@stage0**
